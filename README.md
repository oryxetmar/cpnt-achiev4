Research/ Help:

Self Assessment:
- not thriving
- I am struggling with this for sure. I know it will click but right now I seem to be King of the Breaking All Code Entered 
- to save my damn life i cant get animations to work
- I will figure this out over the weekend

Things I Need to Understand:

I want to figure out 
 - toggling
 - animations triggered by buttons / background color changes
 - at some point : checking boxes to add things to an image? like a menu building pizza

 This is an uphill battle.
